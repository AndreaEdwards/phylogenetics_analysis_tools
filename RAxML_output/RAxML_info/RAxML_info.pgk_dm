IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 33 sequences that are exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
sequence duplicates removed is printed to file /Users/andrea/repositories/phylogenetics_analysis_tools/muscle_output/pgk_out.fasta.reduced
